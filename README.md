# TCL Debloat
**_NOTE: This script (tcl.sh) is only for TCL Android TVs._**

This script is intended to optimize TCL Android TVs by removing applications that are present on the TV which aren't required and slow down the TV. 

This script is based on the work from https://github.com/mickaelmendes50/optimize_android_tv/

## How to run
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robinlennox/tcl-debloat/main/tcl.sh -o tcl.sh; bash tcl.sh
```
